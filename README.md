# ws-express-auto-https-cert-nodejs-template
A template for nodejs webservers dealing with websockets.
## Features:
Creates https certs and renews them automaticy ( May be disabled during configuration. If not enabled, uses a self signed cert THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS REPOSITORY SO IT IS NEARLY USELESS FOR SECURITY )
